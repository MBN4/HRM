# HRM — Project Memory

This file is the persistent memory for this project. Read it before starting
new work, and keep it up to date as the system evolves: append to the BUILD
LOG when a step lands, update NOT YET BUILT as items get built, and extend
CONVENTIONS as architectural decisions get made.

## 1. Overview

HRM is a **global, multi-tenant HR SaaS**, sold under two delivery models:

- **Rented SaaS** — vendor-hosted, multi-tenant, subscription-billed.
- **Lifetime on-prem license** — a customer runs the same codebase on their
  own infrastructure under a perpetual license, single-tenant in practice but
  built from the same multi-tenant core (no forked codebase).

Both delivery models ship from **one codebase**. Behavioral differences
between SaaS and on-prem (billing, licensing checks, update cadence) are
handled by configuration and feature flags, never by branching the code.

## 2. Non-negotiables

- **Scalable** — designed to scale to 20M users. Must degrade gracefully
  under load (backpressure, queueing, circuit breaking) rather than fail
  hard.
- **Secure** — defense-in-depth is mandatory, not optional:
  - Row-Level Security (RLS) for tenant data isolation at the database layer
  - RBAC for authorization
  - Encryption (in transit and at rest)
  - Audit logging of sensitive actions
  - No single layer is trusted alone — assume any one control can fail
- **Customizable without forking** — every country's/tenant's differences
  (legal, payroll, holidays, statutory fields, workflows) are expressed via:
  - **Country Packs** — pluggable, versioned configuration per country
  - **Tenant overrides** — tenant-level configuration layered on top
  - **Feature flags** — for gradual rollout and tenant-specific toggles
  - Forking the codebase per customer/country is explicitly disallowed.
- **Multi-tenant** — a single deployment serves many tenants; tenant
  isolation is a first-class architectural concern, not an afterthought.

## 3. Stack & workspace map

**Stack**: Turborepo + pnpm workspaces · NestJS + TypeScript (API) · Next.js
14 App Router (web apps) · Prisma + PostgreSQL 16 · Redis · BullMQ · MinIO
(S3-compatible object storage, local dev).

| Path              | Purpose                                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/api`        | NestJS backend — all business logic, REST API   |
| `apps/admin`      | Vendor super-admin console (Next.js App Router) |
| `apps/portal`     | Tenant org portal (Next.js App Router)          |
| `packages/db`     | Prisma schema + generated client (`@hrm/db`)    |
| `packages/shared` | Shared types, DTOs, zod validators, constants (`@hrm/shared`) |
| `packages/config` | Shared ESLint / TypeScript / Prettier config (`@hrm/config`) |

Infra for local dev: `docker-compose.yml` runs Postgres 16, Redis, and MinIO.
Every app/package that needs environment variables documents them in its own
`.env.example`.

## 4. Conventions

> This section grows as later steps make architectural decisions. Do not
> leave placeholders unresolved — update this section in the same step that
> makes the decision.

- **Tenancy model** (defined in step 0.2 — `packages/db`):
  - Every tenant-scoped table carries a `tenantId` column (Postgres native
    `uuid`, via Prisma `@db.Uuid` — **not** `TEXT`; RLS policies below cast
    `current_setting(...)::uuid` and need the column type to match), a
    composite index/unique constraint leading with `tenantId`, and a foreign
    key to `Tenant.id`. `Tenant` itself has no `tenantId` (it IS the tenant)
    and is the one table NOT subject to RLS — resolving which tenant a
    request belongs to has to happen before a tenant context exists to
    filter by.
  - Self-relations (`Branch.parentBranchId`, `Department.parentDepartmentId`)
    use a **composite** FK of `(tenantId, parentId) -> (tenantId, id)`, not a
    plain `id -> id` FK. This guarantees a row's parent belongs to the same
    tenant at the schema level, independent of and in addition to RLS —
    defense-in-depth, per the non-negotiables above.
  - Per-tenant-unique columns (`User.email`, `CostCenter.code`,
    `Branch.name`, `Department.(branchId, name)`) use a composite
    `@@unique([tenantId, ...])`, never a bare `@@unique([...])` — uniqueness
    is scoped per tenant, not global.
  - DB column names are `snake_case` (via Prisma `@map`/`@@map`); Prisma
    field names stay `camelCase`. Chosen so hand-written RLS/raw-SQL
    migrations don't need to double-quote camelCase identifiers everywhere.
  - **Row-Level Security** is the hard isolation boundary — enforced in
    Postgres, not just in application code:
    - Enabled by hand-written SQL in the
      `prisma/migrations/<ts>_enable_row_level_security/migration.sql`
      migration (Prisma has no RLS DSL, so this can't be generated from
      `schema.prisma`). Policy: `tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::uuid`,
      applied to both `USING` (reads) and `WITH CHECK` (writes), on every
      tenant-scoped table.
    - No `missing_ok` on `current_setting` — a query issued without a tenant
      context set fails loudly (Postgres error) instead of silently
      returning zero rows. A forgotten tenant-context call is a bug we want
      surfaced immediately, not masked as "no results."
    - **Two DB roles, on purpose.** Postgres skips RLS for superusers, for
      any role with `BYPASSRLS`, and for the table owner (unless
      `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` is set) — so the migration role can never be
      the role the running app queries through, or RLS silently does
      nothing:
      - `hrm` (`DATABASE_URL`) — owns the schema, runs migrations, superuser
        in local dev. Used for `prisma migrate`, seeding, and admin/bootstrap
        tooling only.
      - `hrm_app` (`APP_DATABASE_URL`) — plain login role, `NOSUPERUSER
        NOBYPASSRLS`, created by the RLS migration, granted only
        `SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` on tenant-scoped tables and `SELECT`
        on `tenants`. RLS is enforced against this role. **All** tenant-
        scoped, request-time queries must go through it. Every table also
        has `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` set as a second line of defense (does
        not help against a superuser connection, but protects against a
        future change of table ownership).
      - The `hrm_app` password shipped in the migration is a local-dev
        default, consistent with the other plaintext dev credentials already
        in this repo. Any non-local environment (staging, prod, an on-prem
        install) **must** rotate it immediately after migrating and manage
        that secret outside source control.
    - **`withTenantContext(tenantId, fn)`** (`packages/db/src/tenant-context.ts`)
      is the only sanctioned way to run a tenant-scoped query. It validates
      `tenantId` is a UUID, opens a Prisma transaction against `appPrisma`
      (the `hrm_app`-role client), runs
      `SELECT set_config('app.current_tenant', $1, true)` — the parameterized
      equivalent of `SET LOCAL`, so it's transaction-local and immune to SQL
      injection — then calls `fn(tx)`. Postgres resets the setting
      automatically at COMMIT/ROLLBACK, so there is no separate "reset" step
      and no way for tenant A's context to leak onto a pooled connection a
      later, unrelated request reuses.
    - `packages/db` exports two Prisma Client singletons: `prisma` (owner
      role — admin/migration/seeding use only) and `appPrisma` (restricted
      role — only ever used through `withTenantContext`, never called
      directly). Application code (`apps/api`, once request-scoped tenant
      binding lands in 0.3) must use `withTenantContext`, never `prisma`,
      for anything that touches tenant-scoped tables.
  - Verified by `packages/db/test/tenant-isolation.spec.ts`: tenant A cannot
    read tenant B's rows even with a crafted `where: { tenantId: B }` clause,
    cannot read B's row by primary key, cannot write a row tagged as B
    (`WITH CHECK`), and a query issued with no tenant context at all fails
    instead of silently succeeding.
  - Deferred to later steps, tracked so they aren't silently forgotten:
    `attendance` and `audit_log` (0.9) must be created as **partitioned**
    tables from day one (partition key must be part of every PK/unique
    constraint — see the comment block above the `Tenant` model in
    `schema.prisma`), and the same RLS pattern applies to them.
- **Country resolution** — _to be defined in step 0.5 (country packs), in
  coordination with step 0.3 (tenant resolution)._ Note: country is resolved
  at the **Branch** level (`Branch.countryCode`), not the tenant level — one
  tenant can operate branches in different countries. `Tenant.defaultCountryCode`
  is only a fallback for branches that haven't been assigned one.
- **Tenant resolution** (how a request is bound to a tenant) — _to be defined
  in step 0.3._ Whatever resolves the tenant for a request is also
  responsible for calling `withTenantContext` with that tenant's id — see
  Tenancy model above.
- **Auth / RBAC model** — _to be defined in step 0.4._
- **Licensing model** (SaaS vs. on-prem enforcement) — _to be defined in step
  0.6._

## 5. Build log (append-only)

Append a new entry every time a step from the checklist below lands. Never
edit or delete a prior entry — if something is superseded, say so in a new
entry instead.

- **0.1 monorepo scaffold — done.** Turborepo + pnpm workspace with
  `apps/{api,admin,portal}` and `packages/{db,shared,config}`. Strict
  TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky pre-commit + commitlint wired up.
  `docker-compose.yml` for Postgres 16 + Redis + MinIO. `.env.example` per
  app/package. Prisma schema currently holds only a placeholder `Tenant`
  model, superseded by step 0.2.
- **0.1 verified — 2026-08-24.** `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` both pass
  cleanly from a fresh clone (all 6 workspaces: `@hrm/shared`, `@hrm/db`,
  `@hrm/api`, `@hrm/admin`, `@hrm/portal`, `@hrm/config`). `pnpm lint` passes
  across all workspaces. `docker-compose.yml` validated with `docker compose
  config`. Note for future work: ESLint's shareable-config name resolution
  mangles scoped-package subpaths (e.g. `@hrm/config/eslint-preset.js` in an
  `extends` array) — every `.eslintrc.js` that extends the shared preset must
  use `require.resolve('@hrm/config/eslint-preset.js')` instead of the bare
  specifier.
- **0.2 tenancy model / Row-Level Security — done — 2026-08-24.** Entities:
  `Tenant`, `Branch` (self-relation for hierarchy, branch-level
  `countryCode`), `Department` (self-relation, belongs to a `Branch`),
  `Designation`, `CostCenter`, `User` (per-tenant-unique `email`). Every
  table but `Tenant` carries `tenantId` (native `uuid`), a composite index
  leading with `tenantId`, and — for self-relations — a composite FK back to
  `(tenantId, id)` so a row's parent can never belong to a different tenant.
  RLS enabled via hand-written SQL (`tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::uuid`,
  on both `USING` and `WITH CHECK`, `FORCE`d on every tenant-scoped table)
  against a new non-superuser `hrm_app` role — see § Conventions → Tenancy
  model above for the full design and why two DB roles are required for RLS
  to actually take effect. Files:
  - `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma` — the data model.
  - `packages/db/prisma/migrations/20260824093734_init_tenancy/` — schema DDL.
  - `packages/db/prisma/migrations/20260824093802_enable_row_level_security/`
    — roles, grants, `ENABLE`/`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, policies.
  - `packages/db/src/clients.ts` — `prisma` (owner) / `appPrisma` (`hrm_app`)
    singletons.
  - `packages/db/src/tenant-context.ts` — `withTenantContext`.
  - `packages/db/prisma/seed.ts` — demo tenant `acme-demo` + two branches
    (`countryCode` `US` and `QA`), proving branch-level country resolution.
  - `packages/db/test/tenant-isolation.spec.ts` — 9 integration tests against
    the local Postgres instance, including the crafted-where-clause attack
    and the write-time `WITH CHECK` case.
  - `packages/db/.env` / `.env.example`, `apps/api/.env.example` — added
    `APP_DATABASE_URL`; also fixed the Postgres port to `5433` to match the
    current `docker-compose.yml` (host port was moved from `5432`).
  - `apps/api/package.json` — added `--passWithNoTests` to its `test` script;
    unrelated pre-existing gap from 0.1 (no test files yet) that broke the
    root `pnpm test` once `@hrm/db` gained a real test suite.
  Verified against local Postgres on `localhost:5433`: both migrations
  applied cleanly, `pnpm --filter @hrm/db run seed` succeeds, and
  `pnpm --filter @hrm/db test` passes all 9 tests. Full-repo `pnpm build`,
  `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm test` all pass.
